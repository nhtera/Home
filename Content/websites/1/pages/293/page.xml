Located within the dashboard "web designs" page<br /><br />The Color Scheme Editor is used to quickly change the colors to a web design in order to give it a unique appearance. Many web designs within the Rennder platform already comes with a color scheme, but you can always create your own unique one. <br />
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Add A Color</h4>
Click this button to create a new color within your web design's color scheme. Each color can contain one or more lines of CSS. In order for the system to work, you have to replace hex values (#cc0000) and rgba values with <strong>@color</strong>. After creating your color, you can quickly change the color and view a live preview.<br />
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Select Colors</h4>
Click this button to browse a list of color swatches that were hand-crafted and apply them to your color scheme without affecting any of the colors or CSS you created.<br /><br />]]></component>
